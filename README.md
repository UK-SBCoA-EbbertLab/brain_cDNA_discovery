`article_analysis` - Data analysis and figure generation for article publication. Uses data from output from `cDNA_comparison`, `proteomics_pipeline`, and `epigenetic_analysis`. Some figures were created using the scripts in `website`



`cDNA_pipeline` - In house NextFlow pipeline optimized for analysis of Oxford Nanopore PCR Amplified cDNA sequencing data.


`epigenetics_analysis` - Analysis integrating in house Oxford Nanopore cDNA sequencing results with public epigenetic datasets.


`proteomics_pipeline` - nf-core NextFlow pipeline used to integrate in house Oxford Nanopore cDNA sequencing results with public Mass Spec data.

`website` - Contains Rshiny app scripts used to create a custom website that generates figures for gene and transcript level queries for the in house Oxford Nanopore cDNA sequencing data used in this publcation. Website URL:
